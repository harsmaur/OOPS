                             // Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming//
                             


// Classes - Basic template for creating objects

// Objects –   Basic run-time entities

// Data Abstraction & Encapsulation –   Wrapping data and functions into a single unit

// Inheritance –   Properties of one class can be inherited into others

// Polymorphism –   Ability to take more than one forms

// Dynamic Binding –   Code which will execute is not known until the program runs

// Message Passing – message (Information) call format




                     // difference between Procedure Oriented Programming and Object-Oriented Programming//



// Procedure Oriented Programming//

// Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
// The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data
// Functions can either use local or global data
// Data moves openly from function to function



// Object-Oriented Programming//

// Works on the concept of classes and object
// A class is a template to create objects
// Treats data as a critical element
// Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects
